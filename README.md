## During
- Goal is an algorithm that translate
	- Receives a text file that should follow to DSL
	- Generate UPPAAL XML file
		- Doesnt have to be pretty 
		- Properties might need to be done manually
			- CTL
			- These are the logical queries
		- If they are to be done automatically from the bdd scenarios, i need to define the rules
			- 2nd objective
			- Create rules and tool
	- If my tool can recreate the mapping from the paper, it is succesfull
		- We can then bring a scenario from robotics to validate as well
- For propsoal
	- Important to tell why we are doing this
		- To make it easier for non-formal community to formally verify a system
 ### Goal before next meeting
 - Finish proposal
   - Add 2nd objective: Create rools and tool for mapping scenarios to CTLs
   - Write introduction
     - Motivation for doing the project
 - Research XML format of UPPAAL files
 - Research ways of creating translation tools
 - Create prototype(s) for tool
